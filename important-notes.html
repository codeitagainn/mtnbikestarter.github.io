    <div class="a-few-notes-group">
      <h5 class="resources-group-header"><span>Technology advancements</span></h5>
      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>10 years ago getting a mountain bike that could handle real terrain for under $1000 wasn’t a real option. For that reason the sport was out of reach for a lot of people interested.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>Luckily that is not the case anymore. Mountain biking technology continues to evolve at faster rates than ever and that benefits everyone from 10 year biking veterans to you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>In the past the most expensive bikes were the only ones with the technology capable of handling real MTB terrain without breaking down or leaving your body feeling like you had been jackhammering all day.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>Today all trail bikes that cost thousands of dollars can handle turns with amazing precision at breakneck speeds very advanced suspension. But this also means that the more affordable bikes now have the ability to take on real terrain and real drops. The option to get started without breaking the bank now exists.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="a-few-notes-group">
      <h5 class="resources-group-header"><span>Hardtail v full suspension</span></h5>
      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>The hardtail vs full suspension debate is possibly the most wildly discussed topics in the sport. Try Googling “Hardtail vs Full Suspension” and you will not find a shortage of opinions. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>A TLDR of the debate might look like this:</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>Hardtail pros - Less maintenance, higher quality components at the same price point of the full suspension bikes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>Full suspension pros - smoother ride due to rear suspension, more grip on turns.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>Generally if you are interested in buying a bike for under $1000 you will be better off going with a hardtail. In addition to getting a higher quality bike, you will also become a more technical rider due to not having the rear suspension. It is certainly an easier transition from hardtail to full suspension rider than the other way around.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>If you do want the added comfort of a full suspension bike right away we recommend entering the sport with at least $1500 to spend on a bike.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="a-few-notes-group">
      <h5 class="resources-group-header"><span>Buy a bike you can grow with</span></h5>
      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>An often voiced opinion from riders is to buy a bike for the biker you want to be a year from now.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>We think that sounds nice, but its extremely difficult to predict what kind of rider you will be a year from now.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>Right now you might be thinking you want to fly down an enduro course at high speeds a year from now, but then 12 months later you decide that cross country racing suits you better.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>We tend to think this argument underestimates the complexity of human beings and our continuously evolving nature.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>Taking in the human being factor, we take the stance that you should buy the bike that you think suits you now and you’ll have a far better understanding of the rider you want to be after you hit the trails a few times.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="a-few-notes-group">
      <h5 class="resources-group-header"><span>Female Specific Bikes</span></h5>
      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>You don’t necessarily need one. Women’s bikes were made to factor in differences in geometry. Generally, women’s legs are proportionally longer than men of the same height. This lead to the development of women’s bikes.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>Given the flexible nature of the bike saddles and handlebars many of these differences are negligible. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>Be cautious when purchasing a woman’s bike. Part quality can be worse for the same specifications and price.  Double check that the women’s bike you are looking at has the same kit as the mens for the same price.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>These notes are not universal, so use your own judgement when choosing a bike. If you have a good local bike shop, go there and try out a few before selecting the right bike for you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="resources-group">
        <p>We posted <a href="http://bit.ly/2AGu8YK">this question</a> to Quora to get more opinions on the matter.</p>
